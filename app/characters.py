# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING YOUR OWN CHARACTER FUNCTION

# Name - the name that your model will interpret as its own.
# Persona - A detailed description of your character. This is the most important field so more detail is better. Any gaps left in the persona will be filled by the model with data from its training.
# Questions - A series of questions to give your model context about how it should respond to you.
# Responses - A series of responses to the above questions, again, for context. The more detail the better.

# The number of questions and responses MUST be equal. A ValueException will be raised if not.
# Keep in mind memory limitations of your device and token limitations of smaller models.
