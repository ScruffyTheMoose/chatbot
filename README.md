# Chatbot

Chatbot is a customizable conversational Discord bot based on the [PygmalionAI](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI) large language models! It can be easily hosted on a docker container with minimal configuration.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a Discord account if you don't already have one [here](https://discord.com/) with access to the developer portal and adminstrator privileges in a discord server.

More documentation to come soon - the Dockerfile needs to be completed.
