# Chatbot

Chatbot is a customizable conversational Discord bot based on the [PygmalionAI](https://huggingface.co/PygmalionAI) large language models! It can be easily hosted on a docker container with minimal configuration.

### Prerequisites

In order to get your chatbot up and running, you'll first need to create a Discord account if you don't already have one [here](https://discord.com/).

Once your Discord account is all squared away, make your way to the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). Follow the instructions for creating an application.
The details you assign to your bot in this portal do not effect the model, only how the bot appears in discord.
